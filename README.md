# Hearts of Iron IV Ace Balance Mod

## Description:

The most effective wing size in the game is 1-10, because the bonus from aces are at its highest at 10 % of 100 ( NDefines.NAir.ACE_WING_SIZE = 100; ), so if you want to get the most out of your planes,
you have to micro manage 1-10 air wing size planes in vanilla.

This mod changes the calculation to 10 % of 1000 ( NDefines.NAir.ACE_WING_SIZE = 1000; ), any air wing size under 100 gets the same buffs from aces as 100.

This mod is useful for anybody who hates micromanaging the air war or basically hates losing with more effective
planes against somebody who micromanages 1-10 air wing size planes.

Mod is available on Steam now.
