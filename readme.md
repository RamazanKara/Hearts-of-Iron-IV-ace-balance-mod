# Hearts of Iron IV Ace Balance Mod

## Description:

In the base game, the most effective ace size is 10. That's because the bonus from ace generation is at its highest at 10 % of 100 , so somebody who just plain manages 10 wing size planes is unstoppable with the ace buffs.
This mod actually changes this, by setting the calculation to 10 % of 1000, making any squadron size under 100 as effective as 100. This mod is useful for anybody who hates macroing the air war or basically hates losing with more effective
planes against somebody who micromanages 10 size squadrons.

## Install:
